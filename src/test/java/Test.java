//Staging area is an intermediate area between the directory and a Repo
//it is a temporary staging area
//Working directory is a folder in which we have all the project files like SRC,.idea POM and inside this area we have the staging area and the repo
// if you want all the files and folders(SRC, .idea, POM) inside a Repo use git add. command
//it will make a snapshot  of all files and folders that are inside the project and it's going to place them into staging area
//if you run the command git commit-m "1stname" this will grab the file and folders from the staging area and move to the Repo
//Git AKA 3tage architecture (working directory->staging area->Repo)
// with git status command t can check is there any file in my repo
